# Purpose
  Backlog Booster is a small front-end project used to give the user some direction in choosing the next game they should play based on 
  Cheapshark's API and the Math.random() function built-in to Javascript.
  
# Technologies
  Backlog Booster relies on Cheapshark's API and a few Javascript files to run reliably. Everything should be automated, but customization or modification 
  should come easily if another user wants to modify the Javascript for some different functionality. Not much more than Async functions and forof loops.
  
# Servicing
  There's not much to service for this website. There is no API key, there are no rate limiters, and the JS/CSS should work on many different browsers.
